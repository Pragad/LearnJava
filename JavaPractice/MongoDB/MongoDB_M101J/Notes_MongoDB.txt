HOW TO RUN MONGODB:
    C:\Users\pragadhe>mongod - Will start the server
    C:\Users\pragadhe>mongo  - Will start the shell

Setting Up MongoDB:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2404742/how-to-install-mongodb-on-windows
    - After installing MongoDB, create a /data/db directory
    - Run mongod from a cmd prompt
    - Run mongo from another prompt

    MongoDB Enterprise > db.names.insert({name: "Prag Thiru"})
    WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
    MongoDB Enterprise > db.names.find()
    { "_id" : ObjectId("57fd64c8ee435d20d5b1af97"), "name" : "Prag Thiru" }

Week 1:
    What is MongoDB?
        - It is a document database
        - There is no JOINS from multiple tables (unlike RDBMS where join is required across tables) various entries in the JSON object.
        - So Much easier to distribue or shrad data across multiple servers
        - Thus SCALE OUT is supported through SHARDING feature

        - Enables application developers to design data models for their application

    Building an App using Java and MongoDB
        - MongoD process is the Server that will be running
        - MongoDB shell is a fully functional javascript interpretor
            - Interacts with MongoD through TCP
        - Java Code, Freemarker, SparkJava

    CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
        - Two databases
            i. local
            ii. test
        - "db" holds the current database that you are using
        - $use database_name
            - MongoDB will create a database in a lazy fashion (db will be created on 1st insert)
        - If NO _id is specified to a document, mongodb will insert one by itself
        - Return value of FIND is a cursor object
            
    Maven Dependencies:
        Adding JAVA_HOME to path
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10938635/setting-up-the-path-for-maven-3-0-4-win7
        C:\Users\pragadhe>SET JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101

    Spark Web Framework:
        - http://sparkjava.com/documentation.html
        - Add it to Pom.xml of your project

    Spark and Freemarker:
        - Using get(path,Route) instead of just get(Route)
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23898628/getting-error-route-in-route-cannot-be-applied-to-string

    Spark GET Requests:
        ANATOMY OF SPARK APPLICATION:
        - On the outside we have a web server which is Jetty server
        - Spark has an embedded Jetty Server
        - When a route is create, Jetty server gets started
        - When a request comes in to Jetty, Jetty forwards it to Spark Handler
        - Within Spark Handler we have one or more routes

        1. Browser sends a "GET /" request to Jetty.
        2. Jetty passes the request to Spark Handler. 
        3. Spark matches against GET / request to the appropriate handler and sends the response to client

        IMP: We can also use Wildcards to handle various types of request

    Spark POST requests
        - To handle form requests

Week 2:
    1. Creating Documents:
        - All documents must contain a _id
        - It is the Number to identify a document within a collection
        - All IDs within a Single Collection are Unique

        - We can provide IDs as well

        INSERTMANY():
            - Inserts in order
            - If it finds an entry that is already a DUPLICATE (I.E. if _id is same as previous one)
              then it bails out without adding that entry to db.
            - It would fail with E1000:Duplicate Key Error

            - If you want INSERTMANY to go on and insert other entries without bailing out
                (
                    { }
                ],
                {
                    "ordered" : false
                }
                );

    2. The _id field:            
        -        DATE    |Mac ADDR| PID |COUNTER
                         |        |     |
        - ObjId: - - - - | - - -  | - - | - - - 
          Eg:    580e1873  dad6ec   fdbf  3da06d
        - It is a 12 Byte HEX String

    3. Reading Documents:
        - We can use . (DOT) notation to go under hierarchy. 
        - DOT notation requires QUOTES

        CURSORS
        - find() returns a cursor
        - We should iterate over the cursor to get the values

        - If we don't assign "find" to a $var, mongoDB by default iterates for 20 times
        - First batch will usually be 101 docs

        > var c = db.movieDetails.find();
        > var doc = funtcion() { return c.hasNext() ? c.next() : null; }
        > c.objsLeftInBatch();

        PROJECTIONS:
        - reduce network overhead and processing requirement
        - Supplied a second argument to "find"

        INCLUDE:
        - Document to contain jus a title
        - _id field will always be returned
        - IF you don't want to see _id field, it should be explicitly excluded

        INCLUDE TITLE AND EXCLUDE _ID:
        > db.movieDetails.find({ rated: "PG" }, {title : 1, _id : 0}).pretty()

    4. Comparison Operators:
        - $eq, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte
        - $ne - not equal to
        - $in
          > db.movieDetails.find({ rated : {$in: ["G", "PG", "PG-E"]}})

    5. Element Operators:
